		"nom": "Chapelle Nicolas",

		"description": "I shape my artistic approach around the urban in its strictest definition: what is relative to the city, what belongs to it. Urban areas and their populations, housing and its sociology, means of transport, residential areas, construction sites, advertising, pollution, ruins, etc. Thus, everything that makes up the invisible architecture of cities, materials such as tarpaulins and fences, inspires me in the same way as American artists Oscar Tuazon or David Hammons. In my painting, photography or installation work, I interpret the excess of visual signals and images in our cities and this brings me closer to painters such as Michel Majerus, borrowing from the register of a vernacular culture. Physical wandering in urban space has a major importance in my work. I also use virtual navigation (Google Street View, Mappy, etc.) and these image captures question me as an artist and more generally: how can we find ourselves in these doubles of the world and their temporalities?» — Nicolas Chapelle.",

		"parutions": "« Canvases evoking the colorful interiors of apartments or hotels, roads dotted with gas stations, here and there palm trees, a surfboard leaning against the wall of a shop and seasides where dogs observe each other from afar... Nicolas Chapelle's paintings are an invitation to travel, on a whim, in the form of a road movie under an enormous sun. » — Niko Rodamel"
